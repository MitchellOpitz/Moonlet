**A calming, endless orbit-jumper through space.**  

In Moonlet, patience is part of the journey. Drift in graceful loops around tiny planets, then launch at just the right moment to reach the next. With gravity as your guide, every leap is a quiet rhythm — a game about timing, flow, and trust in motion.
